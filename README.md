# SurfaceReconstruction

Performing isosurface extraction using the marching cubes algorithm. Given the position of numerous particles, I use marching cubes to extract a surface. I experiment with a variety of kernel functions to generate the scalar field required for marching cubes, including gaussian, quartic, cauchy, and metaballs functions.

I was given data reflecting the positions of particles being moved by a control policy developed through reinforcement learning. Each row of the data corresponded to a particular frame of the animation. The animation with particles can be viewed below:
